    <p class="about">
      Solona is a beautiful lil Russian Blue kitty! 
      She is polydactyl, which means she has extra toes, one on her left paw and two on her right. 
      I adopted her on my birthday in November 2022, during my first semester at CalArts.

      Solana's Vibe
    </h3> 
   
    <p>
      There are two words you need to know to understand Solana’s personality. <em>Bad Bitch.</em>
      When I have friends over, she wants everyone's attention and will let us know with a meow but don’t try to pet her or pick her up, she just wants to be stared at. 
      Admired if you will. She is VERY talkative and constantly wants attention but hates to be held. 
      She now will tolerate me holding her but only for a moment and if no one else is around. 
      When she is one on one with someone that is when her cute and cuddly self comes out. 
      Especially at night, she demands all the pets and scratches as long as you leave her on the floor. 
      She loves a necklace, loves to sunbathe, and will meow along with me whenever I sing.
